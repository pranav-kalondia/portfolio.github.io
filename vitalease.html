<div class="para">
    <h2 class="heading1">1. Introduction</h2>
    
    <h3 class="subheading1">Project Overview</h3>
    <p class="para1">Vitalease is a mobile app designed to improve the quality of elderly care by facilitating seamless communication and management between elderly patients and their caretakers. The app features two distinct interfaces: one for the elderly and one for the caretaker, which can be a family member, house help, or any designated individual.</p>
    
    <h3 class="subheading1">Your Role</h3>
    <p class="para1">As the lead UI/UX designer, I was responsible for designing a user-friendly and efficient interface that would cater to the specific needs of both elderly patients and their caretakers.</p>
    
    <h2 class="heading1">2. Problem Statement</h2>
    
    <h3 class="subheading1">Challenges</h3>
    <p class="para1">Elderly patients often face difficulties in managing their medication schedules and handling emergencies, especially when living alone or far from their caretakers. Existing solutions lacked the simplicity and ease of use required for elderly users.</p>
    
    <h3 class="subheading1">Objectives</h3>
    <p class="para1">• Create a user-friendly interface that is easy to navigate for elderly users.</p>
    <p class="para1">• Develop a robust system to manage and update medication schedules remotely.</p>
    <p class="para1">• Ensure quick and reliable emergency communication between patients and caretakers.</p>
    
    <h2 class="heading1">3. Research</h2>
    
    <h3 class="subheading1">User Research</h3>
    <p class="para1">I conducted interviews and surveys with elderly individuals, caretakers, and healthcare professionals to understand their needs, preferences, and pain points.</p>
    
    <h3 class="subheading1">Key Findings</h3>
    <p class="para1">• Elderly users need a simple, intuitive interface with large buttons and clear instructions.</p>
    <p class="para1">• Caretakers require an easy way to manage and update medication schedules remotely.</p>
    <p class="para1">• Quick access to emergency contact was a crucial feature for both users.</p>
    
    <h2 class="heading1">4. Design Process</h2>
    
    <h3 class="subheading1">Wireframes and Prototypes</h3>
    <p class="para1">Initial wireframes focused on creating clear, easy-to-use interfaces for both elderly patients and caretakers. Prototypes were developed using Figma to visualize the flow and interactions.</p>
    
    <h2 class="heading1">5. Final Design</h2>
    
    <h3 class="subheading1">UI Design</h3>
    <p class="para1">The final design features a clean, intuitive interface with large buttons and clear instructions for elderly users. The caretaker interface allows for easy management of medication schedules and emergency contacts.</p>
    
    <h3 class="subheading1">Key Features</h3>
    <p class="para1">• Medication Management: Caretakers can update the medication schedules for patients. The app automatically rings an alarm on the patient’s phone at the specified times to remind them to take their medication.</p>
    <p class="para1">• Emergency Call Button: Patients can press an emergency call button, which instantly dials the number saved in the emergency contact list.</p>
    <p class="para1">• User-Friendly Dashboard: The dashboard provides an overview of the medication schedule, including timings and whether the medication is to be taken after breakfast, lunch, or dinner.</p>
    
    <h2 class="heading1">6. Reflections and Learnings</h2>
    
    <h3 class="subheading1">Challenges Faced</h3>
    <p class="para1">Ensuring the interface was simple enough for elderly users while still providing robust features for caretakers was a significant challenge.</p>
    
    <h3 class="subheading1">What You Learned</h3>
    <p class="para1">I learned the importance of user feedback and iterative design, especially when designing for elderly users with specific needs and limitations.</p>
    
    <h2 class="heading1">7. Conclusion</h2>
    
    <h3 class="subheading1">Summary</h3>
    <p class="para1">The Vitalease app successfully addresses the challenges faced by elderly patients and their caretakers, providing a user-friendly platform for managing medication schedules and emergency communication.</p>
    
    <h3 class="subheading1">Future Plans</h3>
    <p class="para1">Future updates will focus on adding more features such as health monitoring, daily activity logs, and enhanced communication tools between patients and caretakers.</p>
